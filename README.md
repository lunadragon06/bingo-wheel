<h2>Project brief</h2>
I was tasked at my current workplace to create a bingo app based on the user needs of the employees as a starting point. The purpose of this simple bingo application was to create a digital replacement of the traditional bingo cage. Framom wanted an app that they could use to play bingo with in combination with traditional blocks and markers, which could keep better track of current drawn numbers and numbers that have been drawn in the past when employees play the game. 
<br>
<h3>Goal of this project</h3>
Create a simple bingo application that meets the client's and employees' requirements and needs, while offering the most intuitive and seamless user experience possible.
<br>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
Convert hard-coded project in JavaScript in Editor X Velo on Framom's website.
<br>
<h3>Today's solution</h3>
Working with my mentor, Christel, we came up with a very simple yet entertaining design for our bingo game that has a practical working interface üëâ <a href="https://www.framom/no/bingo/">View final app</a> (currently password-protected, only test candidates have access to the link).
